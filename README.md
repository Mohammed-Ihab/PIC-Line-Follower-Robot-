# Line Follower Robot with Obstacle Detection ‚Äì PIC Assembly Project

This is a college project developed using assembly language for the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The robot is designed to follow a black line using infrared sensors and intelligently avoid obstacles using both digital and analog proximity sensors. An LCD provides real-time feedback on the robot's status.

## üöó Project Overview

The robot performs the following functions:

- *Line Following*  
  Using two *infrared sensors*, the robot detects and follows a line on the ground.

- *Obstacle Avoidance*  
  - A *photoelectric switch (E18-B03N1)* acts as a digital proximity sensor. It triggers an *interrupt* when an obstacle is detected.
  - A *Sharp analog infrared sensor* provides distance-based detection:
    - *Red LED: Obstacle is **very close*
    - *Yellow LED: Obstacle is at **mid-range*
    - *Green LED: Obstacle is at a **safe distance*

- *LCD Display*  
  An *alphanumeric LCD* displays the robot's current status (e.g., "LINE FOLLOWING", "STOP  OBJECT DETECTED", etc.).

## ‚ñ∂ How to Run the Simulation

1. Open simulation/Line_Follower_Sim.pdsprj in Proteus.
2. Load simualation/line_follower_robot.HEX into the PIC16F877A in the schematic.
3. Run the simulation.
4. Interact with the line sensors and proximity sensors to observe the robot‚Äôs behavior on the LCD.

## üß† Notes

- Delays will be affected if 4MHz crystal oscillator is not used.
- The analog sensor range thresholds can be adjusted in the code as desired.
- If nothing appears on the LCD even though the connections are correct, the initial delay in LCD_INIT might need to¬†be¬†increased.


## üõ† Tools Used

MPLAB IDE v8.92 ‚Äì for writing and assembling the PIC assembly code

Proteus ‚Äì for simulating the circuit and testing the robot behavior
